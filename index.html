               <h3>The Beginning</h3>
               <p>In June of 2024, I started out on a journey to learn JavaScript. It was an exciting time of learning something new, meeting new people, and taking on new challenges. I had very high hopes of what was to come with this new experince, but then I ran into Assignment 3.</p>

               <h3>The Struggle</h3>
               <p>Assignment 3 was no joke. It's main objective was to crew you up and spit you out so that your weren't even recognizable anymore. This is not going to be easy.</p>

               <h3>Never Give Up</h3>
               <p>I have looked in the face of evil before and nothing measures up to Assignment 3. Even though this challenge is unchartered waters, I will never give up! I will face this evil head on and defeat it if it is the last thing I do! I will be &QUOT;triumphant&QUOT;!</p>
