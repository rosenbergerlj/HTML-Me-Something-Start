               <h3>The Beginning</h3>
               <p>In June of 2024, I started out on a journey to learn JavaScript. It was an exciting time of learning something new, meeting new people, and taking on new challenges. I had very high hopes of what was to come with this new experince, but then I ran into Assignment 3.</p>

               <h3>The Struggle</h3>
               <p>Assignment 3 was no joke. It's main objective was to crew you up and spit you out so that your weren't even recognizable anymore. This is not going to be easy.</p>
